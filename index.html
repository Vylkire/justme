<h1>Welcome to a website, there are many like it, but this one is mine.</h1>
<h2>Some things I have done.;</h2>
<ul>
<li>Took a mis-step with my Bachelor of Chiropractic, it's a long story that ends in debt and frustration but I learned a lot.</li>
<li>Managed a timber mill, it became a family business, it was not for me. I was good at the managment and administration, but bad at being ignored so I changed my path.</li>
<li>My son arrived. He's a handful. I love him dearly.</li>
<li>Got a Bachelor of Computer Science majoring in Software Engineering. I'm out of practice, but the fundamentals of problem solving and logic are the biggest lesson I learned.</li>
<li>Network and Infrastructure Scope and Design for Telstra. I helped businesses build robust infrastructure and built a network security audit product with my team. We were good at what we did.</li>
<li>Worked at a library as a technology officer, advising, managing and teaching in the technology space to provide our library staff and public alike with the ability to access and use technology.</li>
<li>Implemented and co-ordinated the integration and rollout of RFID technology across our library. 15 Branches, 6 LGA's, 2 Vendors, a lot of late nights and travel.</li>
<li>It's a short list, but it hits the highlights. I'm sure more will follow, I'm not dead yet.</li>
</ul>
